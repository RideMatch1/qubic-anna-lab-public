# External Verifications

This directory contains independent verifications from external researchers.

## How to Submit Verification

If you've independently verified the findings, please submit:

1. **Your name/handle** (X/Twitter, Qubic Forum, or GitHub)
2. **Verification method** (what you ran)
3. **Results** (screenshots, output files, or signed statement)
4. **Date** of verification

### Format

Create a file: `VERIFICATION_[your_handle].md` or `VERIFICATION_[your_handle].txt`

Include:
- Your name/handle
- Date
- What you verified (extraction, on-chain check, control group, etc.)
- Results (did you get the same identities?)
- Any notes or observations

### Example

```markdown
# Verification by @your_handle

**Date**: 2025-11-22
**Method**: Ran all extraction scripts + on-chain verification
**Results**: 
- Matrix hash verified: 
- Diagonal identities extracted: (matched documented identities)
- Vortex identities extracted: (matched documented identities)
- On-chain verification: (all 8 identities exist)
- Control group: (0 hits in 1000 random matrices)

**Notes**: Everything reproduced exactly as documented.
```

## Why This Matters

Independent verification is essential for credibility. If multiple researchers can reproduce the findings, it strengthens the evidence significantly.
