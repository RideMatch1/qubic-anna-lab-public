# Comprehensive Scan Results

## Overview

A comprehensive scan was performed on all possible identity candidates extracted from the Anna Matrix using systematic extraction methods. This scan validates identities on-chain to determine how many actually exist.

## Current Status (As of 2025-11-22)

**Progress**: 95.9% complete (22,801 / 23,765 identities checked)

**Results**:
- **Total identities checked**: 22,801
- **On-chain identities found**: 22,522
- **Success rate**: 98.8%
- **Remaining**: 964 identities to check

## What This Means

This comprehensive scan tests a much larger set of identity candidates than the initial 8 identities. The high success rate (98.8%) suggests that:

1. The extraction method is producing valid Qubic identities
2. Most extracted identities exist on-chain
3. The Anna Matrix contains a significant number of valid identities

## Important Notes

- **This is ongoing work** - the scan is not yet complete
- **Final results will be published** when the scan reaches 100%
- **These are identity candidates** - not all may be "intentional" encodings
- **The high success rate** could indicate:
  - The extraction method is effective
  - Qubic identities are common in Base-26 encoded data
  - Or both

## Statistical Context

The initial 8 identities (diagonal + vortex) were found using specific patterns. This comprehensive scan tests a much broader set of extraction patterns.

**Key difference**: 
- Initial 8: Specific patterns (diagonal, vortex)
- Comprehensive scan: Systematic extraction across entire matrix

## When Complete

Once the scan reaches 100%, we will:
1. Publish final statistics
2. Analyze the distribution of on-chain identities
3. Compare with control group results
4. Update statistical significance calculations

- Final results: Will be published when complete

**Note**: This is research in progress. Final results may differ from current status.
