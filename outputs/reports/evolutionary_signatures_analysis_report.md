# Evolutionary Signatures Analysis Report

## Overview

This report analyzes identity patterns for evolutionary signatures.

## Selection Pressure

- **Entropy**: 4.67 (lower = higher selection pressure)
- **Diversity ratio**: 1.0000
- **Unique seeds**: 23,477 / 23,477

### Top Character Distribution

- **a**: 69,991 occurrences
- **m**: 66,483 occurrences
- **q**: 62,757 occurrences
- **c**: 61,822 occurrences
- **e**: 61,009 occurrences
- **n**: 58,336 occurrences
- **g**: 56,988 occurrences
- **j**: 56,406 occurrences
- **x**: 56,262 occurrences
- **v**: 52,012 occurrences

## Fitness Traces

- **Total repeating patterns**: 199,855

### Top Repeating Patterns

- **aa**: 13,090 occurrences
- **cc**: 10,245 occurrences
- **xx**: 10,073 occurrences
- **mm**: 9,522 occurrences
- **zz**: 9,353 occurrences
- **nn**: 8,957 occurrences
- **qq**: 7,054 occurrences
- **ee**: 6,587 occurrences
- **jj**: 5,810 occurrences
- **ww**: 5,804 occurrences

## Mutation Patterns

- **Total mutations analyzed**: 0

## Convergence

- **Total clusters**: 23,383
- **Average cluster size**: 1.00
- **Max cluster size**: 3
- **Convergence ratio**: 0.0001

## Interpretation

If evolutionary signatures are present:
- Low entropy suggests strong selection pressure
- Repeating patterns could indicate fitness function preferences
- Mutation patterns show how identities evolved
- Convergence indicates successful evolutionary paths

**Status**: Patterns suggest non-random distribution. Whether this indicates evolutionary selection requires further investigation.

**Limitations**:
- Patterns could be artifacts of extraction method
- Comparison with truly random seeds needed
- Statistical significance not yet established

## Next Steps

1. Compare with truly random seed generation
2. Analyze mutation patterns in detail
3. Validate with independent methods

**Note**: This analysis is part of ongoing research. Results should be independently verified.
