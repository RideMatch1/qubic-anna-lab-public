# Helix Gate Pattern Analysis Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the Anna Matrix for Helix Gate patterns.

## Helix Gate Operation

Helix Gate: Takes 3 inputs (A, B, C) and rotates them by A+B+C positions.

## Results

- **Total three-input groups found**: 26,562
- **Total rotation patterns found**: 26,562
- **Identity helix groups analyzed**: 74

## Top Rotation Values

- Rotation 78: 269 occurrences
- Rotation 47: 267 occurrences
- Rotation -81: 263 occurrences
- Rotation -50: 263 occurrences
- Rotation 62: 207 occurrences
- Rotation -65: 202 occurrences
- Rotation -66: 182 occurrences
- Rotation 55: 181 occurrences
- Rotation 63: 181 occurrences
- Rotation 14: 181 occurrences

## Interpretation

If Helix Gate patterns are present in the matrix, this would suggest:
- The matrix structure may follow Aigarth's Helix Gate logic
- Identity extraction might be guided by Helix operations
- The matrix could be Aigarth tissue data

**Status**: Patterns found, but correlation with identity extraction requires further analysis.

**Limitations**:
- Pattern detection may produce false positives
- Correlation with identity extraction not yet proven
- Requires independent verification

## Next Steps

1. Analyze correlation between Helix patterns and identity extraction coordinates
2. Compare with known Aigarth Helix Gate operations
3. Validate patterns with independent methods

**Note**: This analysis is part of ongoing research. Results should be independently verified.
