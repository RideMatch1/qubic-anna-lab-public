# Identity Pattern Comparison: Facts

**Date**: 2025-11-22 
**Objective**: Check patterns in identities

Comparing the 180 identities found through comprehensive scanning with the 8 from systematic extraction. Looking for patterns in character distribution, common prefixes/suffixes, that kind of thing.

## IMPORTANT

**Facts only, no interpretations!**

## 1. Comprehensive Scan Seeds (FACTS)

### Basic Statistics
- **Total Seeds**: 180
- **Unique Seeds**: 180
- **Duplicates**: 0

### Most frequent first characters

Some characters appear more often at the start of seeds than others:

- `a`: 32x (17.8%) - most common by far
- `f`: 15x (8.3%)
- `y`: 15x (8.3%)
- `r`: 14x (7.8%)
- `m`: 13x (7.2%)
- `v`: 10x (5.6%)
- `p`: 9x (5.0%)
- `q`: 8x (4.4%)
- `g`: 7x (3.9%)
- `n`: 7x (3.9%)

The 'a' at the start appears frequently - 32 out of 180 seeds start with 'a'. This is more than the ~7 expected from random distribution (1/26 ≈ 3.8%). Whether this is meaningful or a quirk of the extraction patterns is unknown.

### Most frequent last characters
- `a`: 18x (10.0%)
- `x`: 15x (8.3%)
- `b`: 12x (6.7%)
- `t`: 11x (6.1%)
- `y`: 10x (5.6%)
- `d`: 10x (5.6%)
- `n`: 9x (5.0%)
- `k`: 9x (5.0%)
- `r`: 8x (4.4%)
- `f`: 8x (4.4%)

### Frequent substrings (3-5 characters)
- `aaa`: 62x
- `bbb`: 34x
- `bxb`: 31x
- `aya`: 30x
- `aaaa`: 29x
- `xbb`: 23x
- `mmm`: 20x
- `aea`: 18x
- `lll`: 17x
- `aam`: 17x
- `nnn`: 16x
- `yyy`: 16x
- `xxd`: 15x
- `lxx`: 15x
- `bbf`: 15x
- `maa`: 14x
- `blb`: 14x
- `aoa`: 14x
- `yaa`: 14x
- `ayy`: 14x

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Why do these patterns exist?
2. Are they intentional or random?
3. What do they mean?
