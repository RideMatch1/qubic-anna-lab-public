# Comprehensive Scan Identities Analysis

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Total Identities**: 180

This is the analysis of the 180 identities found through comprehensive pattern scanning (not the original 8 from systematic extraction). These came from testing various extraction patterns across the matrix.

## Summary

- **Total analyzed**: 180
- **Unique Seeds**: 180 (no duplicates, which is good - each identity is unique)

## Pattern Analysis

### Most frequent first characters
- `A`: 32x (17.8%)
- `F`: 15x (8.3%)
- `Y`: 15x (8.3%)
- `R`: 14x (7.8%)
- `M`: 13x (7.2%)
- `V`: 10x (5.6%)
- `P`: 9x (5.0%)
- `Q`: 8x (4.4%)
- `G`: 7x (3.9%)
- `N`: 7x (3.9%)

### Most frequent last characters
- `C`: 13x (7.2%)
- `V`: 13x (7.2%)
- `P`: 12x (6.7%)
- `B`: 12x (6.7%)
- `X`: 11x (6.1%)
- `T`: 11x (6.1%)
- `I`: 9x (5.0%)
- `K`: 8x (4.4%)
- `O`: 8x (4.4%)
- `M`: 6x (3.3%)

### Frequent seed patterns (first 5 characters)

Only a few 5-character prefixes appear more than once:

- `awwqq`: 2x
- `fdtjd`: 2x
- `kucos`: 2x
- `nhpgf`: 2x
- `tbxzt`: 2x
- `ykaoa`: 2x

Most seeds are unique even in their first 5 characters, which suggests good diversity. The fact that only 6 patterns repeat (and only twice each) is interesting - could be coincidence or could indicate something about the extraction patterns.
