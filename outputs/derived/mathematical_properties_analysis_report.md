# Mathematical Properties Analysis: Facts

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Objective**: Check mathematical patterns in the matrix

Looking for prime numbers, divisibility patterns, sequences - anything that might indicate intentional construction vs random data.

## IMPORTANT

**Facts only, no interpretations!**

## 1. Prime Numbers (FACTS)

Checked which values in the matrix are prime numbers. Found:

- **Total unique values**: 129 (out of 256 possible values in range -128 to 127)
- **Primes found**: 31
- **Prime ratio**: 24.0%

This is approximately what would be expected from random data - primes are distributed roughly according to the prime number theorem.

## 2. Divisibility (FACTS)

- **Even numbers**: 8250 (50.4%)
- **Odd numbers**: 8134 (49.6%)
- **Divisible by 26**: 760 (4.6%)
- **Divisible by 13**: 1539 (9.4%)

## 3. Modulo Patterns (FACTS)

### Modulo 26 (important for Base-26)
- **Expected**: 630.2 per value (0-25)
- **Actual**: See Base-26 distribution in matrix origin analysis

## 4. Sequences (FACTS)

- **Arithmetic sequences**: 1 found

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Do the mathematical properties have meaning?
2. Why do these patterns exist?
3. Are they intentional?
