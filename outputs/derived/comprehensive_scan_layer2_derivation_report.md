# Layer-2 Derivation: Comprehensive Scan Identities

**Date**: 2025-11-22 10:44:25  
**Total processed**: 180

## Summary

- **Total Identities**: 180
- **Seeds extracted**: 180 (100.0%)
- **Layer-2 derivable**: 180 (100.0%)
- **Layer-2 on-chain**: 110 (61.1% of derivable)

## Findings

**PARTIAL**: 110/180 Layer-2 identities exist on-chain.

Not all Comprehensive Scan identities function as seeds.

## Next Steps

- Comparison with systematic identities
- Pattern analysis of seeds
- Layer-3 derivation (if Layer-2 successful)
